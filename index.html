                    <p>Everybody needs a friend. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. 
                    Don't fight it, use what happens. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Work that paint. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.   
                    This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Don't be bashful drop me a line. <br /><br />We don't have anything but happy trees here. There comes a nice little fluffer. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.
                    See there, told you that would be easy. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.
                    How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Use what you see, don't plan it. The least little bit can do so much. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. 
                    A happy cloud.</p>
